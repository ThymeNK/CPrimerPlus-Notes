   A perfectly portable program is one whose source code can, without modification, be compiled to a successful program on a variety of different computer systems.
   ```
2. Explain the difference between a source code file, object code file, and executable file.
   ```
   A source code file contains code as written in whatever language the programmer is using.  
   An object code file contains machine language code; it need not be the code for a complete program.  
   An executable file contains the complete code, in machine language, constituting an executable program.
   ```
3. What are the seven major steps in programming?
   ```
   a. Defining program objective.
   b. Designing the program.
   c. Coding the program.
   d. Compiling the program.
   e. Running the program.
   f. Testing & debugging the program.
   g. Maintaining & modifying the program.
   ```
4. What does a compiler do?
   ```
   A compiler translates source code (for example, code written in C) to the equivalent machine language code, also termed object code.
   ```
5. What does a linker do?
   ```
   The linker combines translated source code with library code and start-up code to produce an executable program.
