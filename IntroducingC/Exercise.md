# Programming Exercise
1. Write a program that uses one printf() call to print your first name and last name on one line, uses a second printf() call to print your first and last names on two separate lines, and uses a pair of printf() calls to print your first and last names on one line. The output should look like this (but using your name):
   ```
   Gustav Mahler  ←First print
   statementGustav   ←Second print
   statementMahler   ←Still the second
